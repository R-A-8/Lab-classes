It is discussed in chapter 1.

The purpose of this project is to illustrate object interaction and to examine
some simple code. See chapters one and three of the book.

To use this project, create some Student objects, then create a LabClass object.
Add the students to the class using the "enrolStudent" method. Print a class
list.

22. A window opens with the result, which gives the student's name. At the top it says "Return the full name of this student."
24. A window opens with the result, which gives the number of students currently enrolled in the class (which is currently 0).
29. Instructor: "Mr.Instructor"; Class: "A-123"; Time:Friday, 8am".
31. What are the types of the following values?
   0 = int
   “hello” = string
   101 = int
   -1 = int
   true = boolean
   “33” = string
   3.1415 = float/double
32. I would add a "private String name;" at the top of the circle's code.
33.
34.
35. It's an object and its class would be books or textbooks. My textbook is a specific example from the category(class) that is textbooks/books.
36. I think an object can have multiple classes. For example, if I take a specific airplane(like a blue private jet), its class could be "airplanes" in general, but it could also be "modes of transportation".
